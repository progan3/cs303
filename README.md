# cs303

The code takes the vals.txt file and turns it into a vector containing all values. The code then uses functions to modify, add to, and check for values in the vector. It also has a function to turn a specific index into zero. The try/catch blocks work well for the modify function, but gave me an error for the function that adds to the vector, even though it also gave me the correct catch output.
